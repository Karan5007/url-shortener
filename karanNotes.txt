commands to keep on hand when running cluster:
pkill -f 'java SimpleProxyServer' ; echo $?
pkill -f 'java MonitorApp' ; echo $?
rm hosts.properties
pkill -f 'URLShortner' ; echo $?

ifconfig eno1 | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}'


Cluster Set Up: first time! 

1. ensure the state files /monitor/host.properties and proxyServer/savedConsistantHashing are BOTH DELETED.
2. ssh into another node run monitorFirstTime script

sleep (3)

3. back to orginal node, start up proxy

4. serversql ite/StartAll.bash

5. loadTest1 (populate DBs)


Cluster Shut Down: (BYE BYE!)
1. run ./shutdown_all-OldAge (shutdown all scrip but with 10 seconds between each node)
1. remove host.properties file (destory the state)
for x=6 
2. shutdown proxy and shut down monitor

3. remove savedConsistantHashing file
